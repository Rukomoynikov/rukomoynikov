			parent and swapping them if the parent is smaller, continuing until either the root is reached
			or the heap property is satisfied. The remove operation, which always removes the maximum
			value (the root), is more complex. It takes the root value, replaces it with the last element
			in the heap, and then "bubbles down" this element (heapifyDown) by repeatedly swapping it with
			its larger child until it reaches its correct position. This ensures that after any operation,
			the largest value always remains at the root, giving us O(1) access to the maximum value and
			O(log n) time for insertions and removals.`);r(b,T)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var y=s(f,2);l(y,{snippet:"posts/heap-it/max_heap.ts"}),r(t,e)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var $=s(u,2);i($,{children:(t,a)=>{l(t,{snippet:"posts/heap-it/max_heap.test.ts"})},$$slots:{default:!0}});var v=s($,2);p(v,{level:"2",children:(t,a)=>{n();var e=o("Min heap");r(t,e)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var c=s(v,2);i(c,{children:(t,a)=>{l(t,{snippet:"posts/heap-it/min_heap.ts"})},$$slots:{default:!0}});var P=s(c,2);i(P,{children:(t,a)=>{l(t,{snippet:"posts/heap-it/min_heap.test.ts"})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),r(x,h)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{A as component};
