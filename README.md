Hi there!

My name is Max. I work at 360insights as a Software Engineer. In my spare time, I try to explore programming languages, build pet projects and learn how things work (from a math and statistics angles).

My specialization is Ruby and [Java|Type]script, also I'm interested in Elixir and Rust.
