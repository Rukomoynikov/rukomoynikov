Hi there!

My name is Max. I work at Apply4 as a developer. In my spare time i try to explore programming languages, build pet projects and learn how things work (under statistics angle).

Visit my website where you will find some examples of [me being a designer](https://rukomoynikov.ru), [several blog posts](https://rukomoynikov.ru/posts/) and [a formal CV](https://rukomoynikov.ru/cv) :)
